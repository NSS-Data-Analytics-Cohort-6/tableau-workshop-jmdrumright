Post-presentation (v2) commentary:
- Can remove 2013 & 2018 since data doesn't cover those years entirely
- Can add note about Sony Computer Entertainment merging into Sony Interactive Entertainment in Apr 2016
- Note inconsistent axes when comparing top 5 EU vs NA games
- Can add data source link

Final v2 (removed null data years, added top 3 global games):
